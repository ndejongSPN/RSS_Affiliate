Further, Calvin\u2019s theology went beyond just Reformed Biblical interpretation, but it impacted political philosophy. David W. Hall argues that Calvin\u2019s theology contributed greatly to the ideas of republicanism, limited government, separation of powers, civil liberties, among others which are considered pillars of freedom in Western Civilization. This was especially apparent when considering the development of American constitutionalism and the influence of \u201cCalvinism\u201d on the American Founding.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/john-calvin-and-the-foundations-of-american-constitutionalism/\">John Calvin and the Foundations of American Constitutionalism</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
