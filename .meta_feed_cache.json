A flat tax is fairer, simpler, and more transparent than a progressive system, treating taxpayers equally under a single rate while preserving deductions and credits that protect lower-income households. To preserve its economic and fiscal benefits, Iowa\u2019s flat tax must be constitutionally protected, ensuring long-term competitiveness, predictable budgeting, and preventing future legislatures from reversing course with higher progressive or wealth taxes.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/a-decade-in-the-making-a-reform-worth-protecting/\">A Decade in the Making, a Reform Worth Protecting</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
