In response, local governments are sounding the alarm that placing a 2% property tax cap would endanger vital services such as police and fire.<br />\nThis argument is nothing new, and the familiar chorus has been repeated by local governments numerous times as a way to prevent any attempt to control their spending. Further, many local government argue that they cannot limit their spending because they are already operating on \u201cbare bones\u201d budgets.<br />\nLimiting government spending may be one of the most difficult policy challenges confronting government at all levels (local, state, and federal). Government bureaucracies and special interests clamor for more spending and fight ruthlessly to protect and extend their budget line items.   Former President Herbert Hoover correctly described government as having \u201cthe instincts of a vegetable\u201d which keep spreading and growing. This is why the national debt is $38 trillion and rising. Whether it is the property tax situation in Iowa or the national debt, the problem centers on the inability and outright refusal to limit spending. Even efforts to slow the growth of spending, such as the 2% property tax cap, are viewed as a \u201ccut.\u201d<br />\nHistorically, the battle over government spending has always been an aspect of American politics. For fiscal conservatives or \u201cbudget hawks\u201d limiting spending has unfortunately become next to impossible. With demands from government continuing to accelerate, the lack of political will from both political parties to address spending, and even the fault of Americans who expect lower taxes but still expect government to do \u201call of the above\u201d are all contributing problems. It seems like the best outcome is no longer limited government, which has become a slogan, but rather hoping to just slow the growth of government.<br />\nThe battle to limit government has never been easy, and it can be accomplished, but it will take both a renewed sense of principles and leadership. Policymakers can look to history as a guide to learn from past fiscal conservatism who truly championed policies that would limit government.<br />\nOne example at the state level was Minnesota Governor Theodore Christianson, who served as governor from 1925 until he left office in January 1931. Christianson was the<br />\nDuring his time as a state legislator and as governor, Christianson made fiscal conservatism, or \u201ceconomy in government,\u201d a priority. He campaigned on slogans such as \u201cMore Ted, Less Taxes\u201d and was given the nickname \u201cTightwad Ted.\u201d The Farmer\u2019s Independent, which was no supporter of Christianson, sarcastically referred to him as \u201cWatch Dog Ted.\u201d<br />\nAs a conservative, Christianson was especially concerned about preventing the socialist agenda from advancing in Minnesota. He realized that the socialist policies of the Nonpartisan League had advanced and taken root in North Dakota, and the Farmer-Labor Party was now trying to accomplish similar policy goals. In 1924, Christianson was \u201cappealing to the voters to save the state from socialism threatened by the Farmer-Labor Party.\u201d<br />\nChristianson\u2019s fiscal policies reflected those of Presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. During the presidential campaign of 1924, Christianson described Coolidge as extolling \u201cthe ancient and time-tested virtues.\u201d While Coolidge was cutting tax rates, reducing spending, and paying down the national debt at the federal level, Christianson was doing the same in Minnesota. In 1924, Christianson argued that the \u201cdemand for a halting of the increase in taxation and public indebtedness is making itself felt, not only in Minnesota, but throughout the nation.\u201d<br />\nAs a former legislator and chair of the Appropriations Committee, Christianson understood the budget and also the numerous special interests that were clamoring for more spending. He believed that the most urgent economic policy problems consisted of reducing the tax burden, cutting spending, and eliminating debt. As Governor, Christianson even believed that it was a realistic goal that that Minnesota would be \u201ca bondless state in 1935,\u201d that is debt free.<br />\nChristianson later reflected that it was his time as chair of the House Appropriations Committee \u201cthat he began to warn the people of the social and economic consequences of excessive taxation.\u201d<br />\nBoth Harding and Coolidge placed a priority on limiting spending, lowering tax rates, and paying down debt. In 1921, President Harding reformed the federal budget process with the Budget and Accounting Act, which created Bureau of the Budget with Charles G. Dawes and Herbert Lord serving as the first Directors.<br />\nBoth Harding and Coolidge required their administration to attend regular meetings of the Business Organization of the Government, which were orchestrated by both Dawes and Lord. Harding and Coolidge would often attend and even address the meeting. The objective was to get the entire administration aligned with the fiscal policy objectives, which included limiting spending. Dawes would compare the task of cutting spending to having a \u201ctoothpick with which to tunnel Pike\u2019s Peak.\u201d<br />\nChristianson was supportive of the fiscal policies of the Harding and Coolidge administrations. He believed that their budget reform efforts should be replicated at the state level to reduce spending. \u201cI said that the states and their municipal subdivisions have been the principal offenders, and that whereas the cost of federal government in this country has been reduced the cost of state government has continued to increase during the last few years,\u201d noted Christianson.<br />\n\u201cWhy is it that the federal government can reduce its expenditures or at least keep them from increasing and the states cannot,\u201d asked Christianson? The answer according to Christianson was following the example of Harding and Coolidge.<br />\nIn reference to the Budget and Accounting Act, the Bureau of the Budget, and the regular meetings of the Business organization of Government, Christianson argued that governors should follow a similar example. \u201cPresident Coolidge,\u201d stated Christianson, \u201cstands for a policy of economy he can, by handing his orders down through the members of his cabinet, reach every agency of the government and compel economy.\u201d<br />\nGovernor Christianson described his policy as an \u201ceconomy program,\u201d which would center on reforming state government, lowering spending, reducing taxes, and debt reduction.<br />\nOne of the major government reform initiatives that occurred under his watch was the 1925 Reorganization Act, which made the state government more efficient by limiting bureaucracy. The Act created the \u201cBig Three,\u201d which was a three-person commission of Administration and Finance, which centered on reforming statewide accounting systems, reviewing agency and department budget requests, the approval or denial of state funds. Christianson and the \u201cBig Three\u201d also encouraged the use of the veto to limit spending.<br />\nThe 1925 Reorganization Act \u201cadopted a new scheme of organization of the government of Minnesota.\u201d However, Christianson argued that consolidating departments and agencies was not enough to limit government or spending. \u201cWe consolidated a few departments but don\u2019t believe that the mere consolidation of state departments is going to produce very much economy in itself because all that such consolidation does is to make a regrouping of the activity and all the activity is still there,\u201d noted Christianson.<br />\nTo add \u201cteeth\u201d to reorganization, Christianson created a budget system to review spending. Christianson argued that Minnesota\u2019s budget system was \u201csufficiently unique,\u201d and that the \u201cbudget system is not a mere compilation of departmental requests, it isn\u2019t merely an attempt to scale down the departmental requests for legislature. It goes farther than that.\u201d<br />\nChristianson described the process of the Budget Bureau once the legislature had given approval. Once the legislature had approved appropriations the Budget Bureau did not just allow agencies and departments to spend at will. Christianson stated that \u201cwe have a string on that money so that before the head of the Bureau or Department that enjoys that appropriation can spend a dollar of it, he must get specific approval for the expenditure from the Budget Board.\u201d<br />\nThis provided additional oversight into spending. \u201cIn other words, every three months the head of a state department must file with the Budget Board a requisition for the part of its appropriation that it desires to spend during the next three months,\u201d stated Christianson. Also, agencies or departments could not use those dollars until they received approval from the Budget Board.<br />\nChristianson argued that the new budget system would finally elevate the interest of the taxpayers. \u201cUnder the new budget system, stated Governor Christianson, \u201ctaxpayers will be represented before the legislature when it considers requests for appropriations.\u201d<br />\n\u201cIn the past, no one but those wanting to spend the money have been heard,\u201d argued Governor Christianson. As a result, \u201cthe tax spenders have been getting judgement against the taxpayers by default.\u201d The new budget system would provide additional oversight to help limit spending and achieve \u201ceconomy in government.\u201d<br />\nIn reviewing spending, Christianson stated that the Budget Board could either approve, allow, or reduce the spending. To illustrate, Christianson described a hypothetical if a department requested to purchase ten new automobiles and specifically requested that they be Cadillacs.<br />\nThis request would come before the Budget Board, and it would scrutinize whether the ten Cadillacs were necessary. Christianson stated that after the review the Board would inform the department that the \u201conly business we have is to watch you fellows and we have decided that you will get along with six new automobiles for the present.\u201d<br />\nIn addition, Christianson stated that the Board would \u201chave made a survey of the relative efficiency and economy of operation for various motor cars for your inspectors to go around the state with and have concluded they don\u2019t need Cadillacs. We have been standardizing on a cheaper car. Instead of getting ten Cadillacs, we are going to buy six Fords. And you will get six Fords. And you will like it, after a while.\u201d<br />\nChristianson admitted that the Budget Board did not win many friends and the budget system causes friction. This was positive for both government and taxpayers. Christianson argued that \u201cany budget system that is worth the paper the law which created it is written on will cause friction, because if there is no friction between the people who want to spend the taxpayers\u2019 money and those who are charged with the responsibility of saving it, it is a pretty sure thing that it is the tax-spenders and not the taxpayers interests which are being taken care of.\u201d<br />\nIn validating his argument, Christianson argued that federal Bureau of the Budget \u201ccaused friction in Washington.\u201d Limiting spending in the Harding and Coolidge administrations was not an easy process. \u201cA great many people down there don\u2019t like General Lord. Some of them don\u2019t like Coolidge,\u201d stated Christianson.<br />\nHaving friction in a budget system was a sign of good governance according to Christianson. \u201cThere is friction in the operation of any budget system that is effective, because the budget is a brake,\u201d noted Christianson.<br />\nThe Reorganization Act, Christianson argued, granted the Governor and the \u201cBig Three,\u201d the ability to \u201cexercise an absolute control over the spending of state funds.\u201d This provided Christianson with additional oversight and what he referred to as a \u201ccontinuing veto on expenditures.\u201d<br />\nGovernor Christianson and the \u201cBig Three\u201d were successful in their objective of providing greater oversight of spending. As an example, during the \u201cfirst year they reduced the state\u2019s printing bill more than $75,000 and its telephone bill $9,000.\u201d The \u201cBig Three\u201d also saved $17,000 by changing the way the state purchased coal and $4,000 in savings by switching from buying \u201cwriting paper by the ton instead by the ream.\u201d By negotiating new fuel contracts for state vehicles, the \u201cBig Three\u201d was able to save another $20,000. In addition, the \u201cDepartment of Agriculture and that of dairy and food together managed to get along on $25,000 less than they had spent the previous year\u2026\u201d<br />\nAfter the first year, Governor Christianson noted that the \u201cBig Three\u201d Commission \u201chad saved the taxpayers more than $680,000 of the  $14,700,000 appropriated for the departments and activities directly under its financial supervision.\u201d Later Christianson would reflect that both the new budget system and the reorganization  of state government were the \u201coutstanding achievements\u201d of the legislature.<br />\nAs Governor, Christianson was unafraid to exercise his executive power, especially regarding the use of the veto. As governor, Christianson was the first executive to use the veto power extensively to limit spending. The Mahnomen Pioneer noted that during the 1925 legislative session the \u201cGovernor vetoed 12 bills, many of which would have created new state boards or would have involved future expense.\u201d<br />\nDuring his 1926 campaign, he celebrated his use of the veto that in one year \u2014 1925 \u2014  saved taxpayers over $1.8 million. During his time in office, Governor Christianson would use the veto 76 times, which accounted for almost $18 million in savings. The veto was instrumental in helping Christianson limit spending. As a result, the legislature in 1925 \u201cappropriated $41.6 million, the 1927 legislature, $40.6 million; and the 1929 legislature, $42.2 million.\u201d Christianson\u2019s overall budget goal for the legislature was to hold appropriations to the \u201camounts for the prior biennium.\u201d<br />\nChristianson was even mocked by his political opponents for his fiscal conservatism. This was especially true of those allied with the Farmer-Labor Party and Nonpartisan League. The Organized Farmer, a socialist newspaper, compared the Governor to a pouting child if he did not get his way on fiscal matters. \u201cTed is known to stamp both feet when he can\u2019t get what he wants, just like a three-year old\u2026,\u201d editorialized The Organized Farmer.<br />\nWhen The Organized Farmer learned that Christianson had read from their paper at a campaign rally, they applauded themselves for provoking the governor in his direct response. \u201cIt, of course, is gratifying to the local weekly paper to have the governor of this state carry a real progressive newspaper in his pocket, in order to give him something more to talk about besides the 13 cents that he saved per ton in purchasing coal for the state in his campaign speeches,\u201d noted the sarcastic Organized Farmer.<br />\nThe Organized Farmer\u2019s lampooning of Christianson\u2019s efforts to limit government failed to win converts. Minimizing the coal savings did not project the accuracy of what Christianson was able to accomplish. \u201cWhile nearly every state in 1925 showed increases in appropriations\u2026Minnesota appropriations were held down to the level of 1923\u2026,\u201d stated The Redwood Gazette.<br />\nThe Redwood Gazette reported that \u201cMinnesota is one of the few states where the mounting cost of state government has been checked.\u201d Representative Ray J. Quinlivan stated that \u201cMr. Christianson has redeemed the pledges he made in the 1924 campaign and has not only checked the rising tide of state expenditures but has effected a reorganization which is bringing greater economy.\u201d<br />\nDuring the 1929 legislative session, Christianson vetoed three appropriations in a budget bill that accounted for over $15 million. In his veto message, Governor Christianson argued that \u201cevery additional dollar must come from increased exactions from the owners of real and personal property.\u201d In other words, the increased spending would result in a property tax increase.<br />\n Another significant veto occurred when Governor Christianson received a $21 million school aid and university maintenance bill from the legislature. The Governor believed that this was too extravagant and \u201cstruct out the appropriations for school aid and university maintenance, aggregating $18,000,000\u2026\u201d<br />\nIn his Farewell Address, Governor Christianson stated that the use of the veto helped in the reduction of state spending. \u201cThe reduction of state spending was accomplished by the veto of appropriation items\u2026,\u201dargued Christianson.<br />\nJust as with Presidents Harding and Coolidge, conservative budgeting and limiting spending were not easy policies for Governor Christianson. \u201cGovernor Christianson has not had an easy course, but he has kept the faith with the people of the state,\u201d noted the Kanabec County Times.<br />\nAs an example, his exercise of the veto power resulted in conflicts with the legislature. During the 1929 session the legislature passed a $5,000 appropriation for the Hospital for Crippled Children. Christianson believed that the amount was too high and instead of vetoing the entire appropriation he used executive power to lower the amount to $4,000.<br />\nIt merits consideration to understand why Governor Christianson would even consider lowering an appropriation directed toward caring for crippled children. Christianson was not cold hearted, but rather the money was directed toward the improvement of the grounds. \u201cOrdinarily, I would not object to appropriations for the Hospital for Crippled Children, for this institution not only is doing much practical good, but has strong sentimental appeal,\u201d stated Governor Christianson in his veto message, which also reflected his ability to review appropriations.<br />\nAs Governor, he argued that he should have the ability to reduce appropriations rather than using the veto. The lowering of the Children\u2019s hospital appropriation is just one example of the conflict that he had with the legislature over his use of the veto.<br />\nThe Kanabec County Times described Christianson as being \u201cfearless and independent.\u201d \u201cThis course may have made some enemies, but it has also made thousands of new friends who admire a man of his uncompromising type.\u201d Certainly, his use of the veto, which often struck down appropriations for public education, was not viewed with popularity. The Mahnomen Pioneer stated that \u201cGovernor Christianson by his action set a record for making slashes in appropriations\u2026He also acquired a record for vetoes.\u201d<br />\nFinally, Christianson argued that \u201ceconomy in government\u201d was not just a responsibility for state government. He argued that it was also imperative that localities also practice fiscal conservatism by limiting spending, lowering tax rates, and paying down debt. The responsibility of the state government was to set an example for local governments. \u201cEconomy in state government should set an example for communities,\u201d as Governor Christianson argued.<br />\nAt the close of one legislative session, Governor Christianson even lamented the legislature\u2019s failure to enact legislation to force local governments to pay down their debts. \u201cIn my opinion the most serious mistake of the session was the failure to enact legislation compelling local units of government to provide definite and irrevocable means for the liquidation of their bonded indebtedness,\u201d stated Governor Christianson.<br />\nChristianson was not always satisfied with the progress of his \u201ceconomy in government\u201d agenda. He praised the reorganization of government and the budget reforms but also argued that they could have been strengthened. He even lamented that at times the \u201clegislature appropriated too much money.\u201d<br />\nOverall, Governor Christianson would leave a record of fiscal conservatism. He described his six years in office as \u201ceventful, and several distinct trends had been established in state policy:<br />\n\u2022\tThe state tax levy had been reduced from $27,201,582.30 a biennium to $23,620,012.86, a reduction of 13 percent.<br />\n\u2022\tLegislative appropriations had been cut $4,000,000 by executive veto.<br />\n\u2022\tThe amount of certificates of indebtedness outstanding had been reduced from $15,719,000 to $3,567,758.83, a reduction of 80 percent.<br />\n\u2022\tThe state trust funds had grown from $53,000,000 to $77,000,000.</p>\n<p>The New York Times noted that \u201cMinnesota has been making a sincere effort to reduce tax burdens for the last six years\u201d under the leadership of Governor Christianson. Tax reduction was \u201cthe chief undertaking of his administration,\u201d reported The New York Times.<br />\nIn our current era we clearly need more policymakers who share the fiscal conservatism of Governor Christianson. Christianson would not accept \u201cslowing the growth\u201d as an option nor would he entertain the notion that limiting spending will result in the loss of services.<br />\nFundamentally, Christianson understood the root cause of the problem was not necessarily with politicians or their spending, but rather it was a cultural problem. \u201cSo I suspect if we want to stop this increase in the cost of government the first thing that we will have to decide to do is get along with less government or at least to put a stop to it when somebody tries to increase its functions and activities unduly,\u201d argued Christianson.<br />\n\u201cNow what are we going to do about it? Is there any way in which this increase in public expenditures can be halted or must we face complacently a constant increase in this burden of government,\u201d asked Christianson? Unfortunately, we have become complacent or even numb to the increase in government spending.<br />\nComplacency is dangerous, which is why the national debt is $39 trillion and many state and localities are confronted with a fiscal crisis. Christianson argued that that \u201cthere are forces and factors over which the government does have control,\u201d to limit spending. These fiscal tools included reforming and reducing the size and scope of government, budget reforms to scrutinize spending, and limit government debt. Policies such as a 2% spending cap to limit spending. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/from-limited-government-to-slowing-the-growth/\">From Limited Government to \u201cSlowing the Growth\u201d</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
