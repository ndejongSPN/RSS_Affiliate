Although I was but thirteen years old, the subject interested me exceedingly. The study of it which I then began never ceased, and the more I study it, the more I have come to admire it, realizing that no other document devised by the hand of man ever brought so much progress and happiness to humanity. The good it has wrought can never be measured.\u201d<br />\nThe education Coolidge received was very different from what most students\u2014especially those in public schools\u2014receive today. The importance of studying American history, government, and Western civilization can no longer be sidelined. Too often, discussions about education focus solely on spending, finance, or the promotion of STEM programs\u2014science, technology, engineering, and math.<br />\nOf course, students need a curriculum that prepares them for higher education and the workforce. But education must also do more\u2014it should prepare students to be informed, responsible citizens. Education is not just about acquiring skills; it is about citizenship.<br />\nFor decades, the nation has faced a civic education crisis. Students are leaving K\u201312 schools and colleges with an alarming lack of understanding of American history, government, and Western civilization. Too often, civics instruction has become politicized, with curricula emphasizing narrow or revisionist viewpoints rather than a balanced appreciation of our shared history.<br />\nAs a result, many young people are developing shallow or distorted views of America\u2019s founding principles and institutions. Classrooms increasingly frame citizenship in global rather than national terms, and higher education is often dominated by a limited range of political and cultural perspectives.<br />\nIn response, the Iowa Legislature has acted to strengthen civic education and refocus instruction on the values of liberty, republican self-government, and civic virtue that define the American tradition. In 2024, lawmakers directed a revision of the state\u2019s social studies standards to ensure those principles are emphasized throughout the curriculum. The standards remain under review, but the goal is clear: reinforce rigorous instruction in American history, government, and Western civilization so that every Iowa student gains a deeper understanding of what it means to be an informed citizen.<br />\nThe Legislature also required all high school students to pass the U.S. citizenship exam before graduation. This modest measure at least ensures that students demonstrate a basic understanding of our nation\u2019s founding and institutions. Iowa already requires high school students to complete a course in civics prior to graduation, but strengthening the standards in the curriculum is essential to reversing the decline.<br />\nWhen it comes to higher education the situation is different. Iowa\u2019s Regent Universities do not require a course in civic education to graduate. Further, the James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal notes that Iowa\u2019s flagship institution, the University of Iowa, is absent from the list of the \u201cmost civically aligned teacher preparation programs.\u201d<br />\nAmerica\u2019s civic ignorance contributes to its deep divisions. Patrick J. Buchanan warned in The Death of the West:<br />\n\u201cHow does one sever a people\u2019s roots? Destroy its memory. Deny a people the knowledge of who they are and where they came from... Destroy the record of a people\u2019s past, leave it in ignorance of who its ancestors were and what they did, and one can fill the empty vessels of their souls with a new history.\u201d<br />\nPolitical philosopher Russell Kirk echoed this sentiment, writing that \u201cignorance is a dangerous luxury\u201d and that Americans who lack understanding of their nation\u2019s principles \u201cwill be susceptible to ideologies and endanger the moral security of the nation.\u201d<br />\nThis civic decay explains why anti-American sentiment is rising among young people\u2014and why so many now embrace socialism and even communism. How can constitutional principles like federalism or the Electoral College survive if they are no longer taught or understood?<br />\nThis doesn\u2019t mean avoiding difficult chapters in our history, such as slavery.  In fact, Americans have a duty to develop an informed knowledge of history and institutions.  As author James S. Robbins wrote in Erasing America, \u201cHistory is the source of all life\u2019s lessons, the good and the bad.

It should inspire patriotism, respect for America\u2019s heritage, and a lifelong desire to learn\u2014just as it did for Coolidge. We owe it to both our ancestors and future generations to preserve our Republic and its ideals.<br />\nIt\u2019s time to restore that lesson to our schools and to heed the advice President Ronald Reagan provided us, \u201cLet\u2019s start with some basics: more attention to American history and a greater emphasis on civic ritual.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/rebuilding-civic-knowledge-for-the-next-generation/\">Rebuilding Civic Knowledge for the Next Generation</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
