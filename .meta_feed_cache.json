While administrators draft proposals, boards hold the legal responsibility to set priorities. Claims that \u201cwe have no choice\u201d should be questioned, because budgeting always involves tradeoffs in programs, staffing, compensation, benefits, and district structure. Spending decisions should be evaluated through a per-pupil and outcomes lens. Enrollment trends drive funding, making per-pupil spending a critical metric. Programs and projects\u2014whether new buildings or tutoring initiatives\u2014should be evaluated based on cost per student and measurable results. Long-term sustainability requires aligning staffing, compensation, facilities, and reserves with enrollment realities. Declining enrollment and rising benefit costs create financial pressure, making it essential to right-size operations, strategically reward effective educators, responsibly manage benefits, and use reserves for stability, not to delay difficult decisions.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/school-budget-questions-we-should-be-asking/\">School Budget Questions We Should Be Asking</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
