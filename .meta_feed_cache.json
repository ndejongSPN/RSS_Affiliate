A budget-continuation, or \u201cno shutdown,\u201d rule would ensure government operations continue by temporarily extending the prior year\u2019s budget during impasses or emergencies.

Last year, Iowans once again watched Washington struggle through another federal government shutdown. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/session-preview-no-shutdown-rule/\">Session Preview: No Shutdown Rule</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
