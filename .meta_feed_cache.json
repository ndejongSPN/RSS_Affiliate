Meaningful reform must occur at the federal level by modernizing compliance standards and disclosure rules; state-by-state approaches risk creating confusion without fixing the underlying problem.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/the-cost-of-an-unforgiving-compliance-system/\">The Cost of an Unforgiving Compliance System</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
