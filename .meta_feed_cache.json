If approved, these measures could represent more than $150 million in potential property tax collections over the next decade, while RPS proposals would allow districts to redirect sales tax revenue from property tax relief to infrastructure projects. With historically low turnout in March special elections, a small percentage of voters may determine tax policy in their communities for years to come.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org/low-turnout-election-long-term-taxes-whats-at-stake-on-march-3/\">Low-Turnout Election, Long-Term Taxes: What\u2019s at Stake on March 3</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://itrfoundation.org\">ITR Foundation</a>.</p>",
