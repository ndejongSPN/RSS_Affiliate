&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has stirred the hornet’s nest with his preference for tariffs. The President has even described the word “tariff” as one of the most beautiful words in the English language. Perhaps more than any other policy, including immigration, President Trump’s protectionism is the most controversial. For many within the conservative movement, tariffs are a betrayal of free-market economics and a rejection of the “true spirit” of Reagan conservatism. Further, protectionism is often assumed to be a policy favored by progressives and socialists.&lt;/p&gt;

With one exception. In 2013, the year after Barack Obama’s re-election, Virginians&amp;#160;sent&amp;#160;Democrat&amp;#160;Terry McAuliffe&amp;#160;to the Governor’s Mansion.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;The background to that&amp;#160;should send a chill&amp;#160;down&amp;#160;the spine of gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger.

&lt;p&gt;The assertion is often made that we live in “Alexander Hamilton’s America.” Hamilton, a co-author of The Federalist, served as Secretary of the Treasury under President George Washington and was the principal architect of that administration’s policies. As a leader of the Federalist Party, Hamilton often clashed with his Democratic-Republican critics, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, primarily over the role and scope of the federal government in relation to the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;

While Washington’s politicians argue, states like Iowa are left dealing with the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time we’ve seen dysfunction in D.C., and it likely won’t be the last. But for Iowans, the shutdown is a sharp reminder of just how dependent our state and local governments have become on federal money.&lt;/p&gt;
