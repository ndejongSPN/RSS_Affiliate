Changes in revenue and spending can be a key indicator of state priorities for the size and scope of government, as well as a state’s overall health and economic output. Oftentimes revenue and expense growth tracks with the rate of inflation, as well as increases in wages and property values. However, state and local governments have generally grown larger overtime, having tripled inflation-adjusted spending from 1997 to 2021. State revenue and expenditures can also be impacted by variations in geography, demographics, history, and other external factors. Growth of expenses State’s expenses fluctuate over time.

&lt;p&gt;One of the taskforce’s key recommendations for improving outcomes is the implementation of merit pay for teachers. Under a merit-based system, teacher compensation would be directly linked to student achievement. “Our current system rewards teachers and administrators based on seniority or the duties they take on, with no connection to student success. This system does not reward excellence in education,” noted committee member Jeff Lutz.&lt;/p&gt;
