&lt;p&gt;States are choosing two very different paths. High-tax, high-spending states are running growing deficits, while reform-oriented states are cutting income taxes, controlling spending, and becoming more competitive. The push to eliminate income taxes is accelerating. States like Missouri, Louisiana, West Virginia, and especially South Carolina are using revenue triggers and disciplined budgeting to move toward flat—or zero—income taxes. Iowa can’t afford to get complacent. Iowa’s 3.8% flat tax and Taxpayer Relief Fund put it ahead today, but other states are catching up—continued spending restraint and long-term tax reform are essential to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governor Reynolds has proposed a $9.6 billion FY27 budget that modestly increases spending while education and health services, driven primarily by K-12 funding and Medicaid, continue to dominate state expenditures, consuming roughly 84 percent of the General Fund. Although Iowa is projecting a $1.2 billion revenue shortfall due to the fully phased-in 3.8 percent flat tax, this reflects a planned transition rather than a structural deficit, with the Taxpayer Relief Fund intentionally built to cushion revenues during tax reform. Iowa’s fiscal position remains strong with substantial reserves, but continued growth in major spending programs and federal uncertainty underscore the need for spending restraint and conservative budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax revolts are a recurring feature of American history, from the founding era through Proposition 13 in the 1970s, and the Tea Party movement, each reshaping tax policy and political priorities in its time. Today, property taxes are again reaching a breaking point, with taxpayers nationwide demanding relief and states pursuing widely different strategies—from caps and assessment limits to outright elimination proposals. The most durable reforms focus on limiting government spending, recognizing that rising property taxes are driven less by valuations than by local spending growth, and that lasting relief requires rethinking the size and scope of government.&lt;/p&gt;
