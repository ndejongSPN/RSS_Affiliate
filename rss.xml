&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s property tax crisis is fundamentally a spending challenge, not a revenue challenge. As lawmakers continue to debate reform, they should focus squarely on limiting local government budgets—including those of school districts. The key to lasting property tax relief lies not in shifting dollars around, but in spending discipline at every level of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over six years, Iowa has climbed from 44th to 17th in the Tax Foundation’s competitiveness rankings—proof that years of conservative budgeting and tax reform have turned one of America’s least-friendly tax codes into a national model.&lt;br /&gt;
Governor Kim Reynolds’ 3.8% flat income tax, paired with falling corporate rates and a strong Taxpayer Relief Fund, has made Iowa a regional leader for growth and investment—outpacing neighboring states and inspiring others like Georgia to follow suit.&lt;br /&gt;
To sustain its momentum, Iowa must address high property taxes, apply the same spending discipline at the local level, responsibly lower the flat rate using revenue triggers, and safeguard taxpayer protections to keep its pro-growth policies permanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular attendance is one of the most important predictors of student success. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw firsthand how inconsistent attendance undermined learning, lowered test scores, and set back student achievement across the country. Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing 10% or more of scheduled school days or instructional hours during a grading period. In an 180-day school year, that’s 18 or more missed days. Across the United States, chronic absenteeism surged from 15% in 2018 to 28% in 2022. Although some states have recovered from pandemic-era highs, many remain above pre-pandemic levels — and Iowa is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
