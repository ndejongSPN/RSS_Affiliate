&lt;p&gt;Vermont is facing a projected 12% property tax increase, driven by declining student enrollment and rapidly escalating public education spending—now over $29,000 per pupil.&lt;br /&gt;
 Lawmakers passed Act 73 to restructure the education system and reduce long-term costs, but disagreements remain over school consolidation and implementation, while other states like Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and South Dakota are considering similar reforms.&lt;br /&gt;
The Vermont experience shows that buying down taxes with surplus funds does not solve underlying funding problems, and provides a warning to states like Iowa that durable property tax relief depends on structural reform and spending restraint—not temporary patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s 3.8% flat tax is the culmination of a decade-long reform effort, beginning in 2018, made possible by conservative budgeting, spending restraint, and structural tax reforms, not a one-time tax cut or temporary policy experiment. A flat tax is fairer, simpler, and more transparent than a progressive system, treating taxpayers equally under a single rate while preserving deductions and credits that protect lower-income households. To preserve its economic and fiscal benefits, Iowa’s flat tax must be constitutionally protected, ensuring long-term competitiveness, predictable budgeting, and preventing future legislatures from reversing course with higher progressive or wealth taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Mellon believed durable tax reform requires spending restraint and debt reduction first, arguing that balanced budgets, and not higher tax rates, are essential to long-term prosperity and revenue stability.&lt;br /&gt;
Mellon warned that high tax rates discourage investment, encourage avoidance, and ultimately harm economic growth while failing to deliver the promised revenue gains.&lt;br /&gt;
His principles offer clear guidance for Iowa today: limit government spending, apply tax relief broadly rather than selectively, and recognize that lower tax burdens can strengthen economic growth without a harmful reduction in revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
