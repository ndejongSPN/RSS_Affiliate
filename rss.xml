&lt;p&gt;Gov. Kim Reynolds is a conservative leader who knows what she believes and has the courage to defend her values and convictions. “One of the great debates of our time is about how much of your money should be spent by the State and how much you should keep to spend on your family. Let us never forget this fundamental truth: the State has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves. If the State wishes to spend more it can do so only by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more. It is no good thinking that someone else will pay — that “someone else” is you. There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money,” stated British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property taxes in Iowa are unpredictable and burdensome, driven by many layers of government that often leave homeowners frustrated as bills rise faster than their ability to pay.&lt;br /&gt;
Effective property tax rates vary widely across the state, with homeowners in places like Eldridge and Le Mars paying under 1.3%, while residents in Waterloo and Keokuk face rates above 2%.&lt;br /&gt;
 Without meaningful reform to limit local government spending, these disparities and rising bills will continue, making property tax relief one of the most pressing issues for Iowa families and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
