&lt;p&gt;Governor Reynolds has proposed a $9.6 billion FY27 budget that modestly increases spending while education and health services, driven primarily by K-12 funding and Medicaid, continue to dominate state expenditures, consuming roughly 84 percent of the General Fund. Although Iowa is projecting a $1.2 billion revenue shortfall due to the fully phased-in 3.8 percent flat tax, this reflects a planned transition rather than a structural deficit, with the Taxpayer Relief Fund intentionally built to cushion revenues during tax reform. Iowa’s fiscal position remains strong with substantial reserves, but continued growth in major spending programs and federal uncertainty underscore the need for spending restraint and conservative budgeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax revolts are a recurring feature of American history, from the founding era through Proposition 13 in the 1970s, and the Tea Party movement, each reshaping tax policy and political priorities in its time. Today, property taxes are again reaching a breaking point, with taxpayers nationwide demanding relief and states pursuing widely different strategies—from caps and assessment limits to outright elimination proposals. The most durable reforms focus on limiting government spending, recognizing that rising property taxes are driven less by valuations than by local spending growth, and that lasting relief requires rethinking the size and scope of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three property tax reform plans share a core idea: a 2% annual cap on property tax revenue growth for cities and counties, aimed at slowing rising property tax bills for Iowa homeowners. Local government critics claim a 2% cap is unworkable, arguing it would undermine public safety, infrastructure, and basic services, but those claims ignore what’s already happening on the ground. Dozens of Iowa cities and counties are already living within a 2% cap, with 100 cities and 33 counties holding growth to 2% or less, proving the policy is practical and achievable without sacrificing essential services.&lt;/p&gt;
