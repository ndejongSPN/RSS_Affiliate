&lt;p&gt;Rollback limits how fast taxable values grow—not how much governments tax. Iowa’s rollback prevents rapid increases in assessed property values from automatically turning into equally rapid increases in taxable value, providing predictability for taxpayers, but it does not cap local government spending or levy rates. The 3% cap is statewide and interacts with agriculture through the “Ag Tie.” Residential taxable value growth is capped at 3% statewide—and can be capped lower if agricultural values grow more slowly or decline—meaning individual properties, cities, or counties are not capped independently. Rising tax bills are driven by spending decisions, not rollback failure. Even with rollback in place, property tax bills can rise significantly when local governments increase spending; eliminating rollback would expose taxpayers to more volatility without addressing the real driver of higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory reform is a structural issue of governance and accountability, centered on who makes the rules that shape Iowa’s economy and whether major policy decisions are made by elected lawmakers or unelected agencies. Large, costly regulations act as a hidden tax on Iowans, raising prices, slowing growth, and reducing opportunity—yet often take effect without the same scrutiny applied to major spending or tax decisions. REINS-style reforms emphasize legislative oversight, transparency, and separation of powers, seeking to restore lawmaking authority to the legislature while ensuring agencies implement the law as written, not expand it through regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are choosing two very different paths. High-tax, high-spending states are running growing deficits, while reform-oriented states are cutting income taxes, controlling spending, and becoming more competitive. The push to eliminate income taxes is accelerating. States like Missouri, Louisiana, West Virginia, and especially South Carolina are using revenue triggers and disciplined budgeting to move toward flat—or zero—income taxes. Iowa can’t afford to get complacent. Iowa’s 3.8% flat tax and Taxpayer Relief Fund put it ahead today, but other states are catching up—continued spending restraint and long-term tax reform are essential to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
