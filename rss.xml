&lt;p&gt;Iowa has been rated as one of the most fiscally prudent states for several years running, due to sound tax and spending policies. Yet thanks in part to a recent downturn in the agricultural economy, economic growth in the state has slowed. Additionally, the state has been losing residents to other states every year since 2013, and has one of the highest outflows of young residents with bachelor’s degrees, leading to some concern over a potential “brain drain.” Though government spending is often lauded as a tool for addressing these sorts of trends, Iowa will be better served by continuing to follow a path of fiscal conservatism. &lt;/p&gt;
