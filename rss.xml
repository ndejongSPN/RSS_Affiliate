&lt;p&gt;Roosevelt emphasized the burden of local government, noting that half of taxpayer dollars went to cities, counties, and townships, and urged local officials to cut waste and deliver better value to taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though his later policies contradicted this message, Roosevelt’s campaign remarks offer a surprising blueprint for Iowa policymakers today as they pursue property tax reform and spending restraint.&lt;/p&gt;
