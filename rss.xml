&lt;p&gt;Iowa can deliver meaningful, lasting property tax relief by focusing reform on two areas: capping local government spending growth at 2 percent and replacing Iowa’s ineffective notification system with a Minnesota-style Truth-in-Taxation model. A spending cap would confront local government spending, the primary driver of Iowa’s rapidly rising property taxes, and treat all taxpayers fairly while improving competitiveness and protecting property rights. A clearer, standardized transparency notice would empower taxpayers to understand proposed tax impacts, increase participation in local budget hearings, and hold governments accountable, aligning directly with all five principles of sound tax policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affordability challenges stem from rising local government spending, not an elusive formula of tax incentives and abatements, and property taxes remain high because spending continues to outpace taxpayers’ ability to pay. Targeted tax abatements and business incentives have failed to deliver broad affordability, instead shifting tax burdens onto other residents while benefiting a narrow group of property owners or employers, often for a limited amount of time. True affordability requires fiscal restraint and broad-based tax relief, not expanded incentive programs or policy tweaks that avoid confronting the underlying spending problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vermont is facing a projected 12% property tax increase, driven by declining student enrollment and rapidly escalating public education spending—now over $29,000 per pupil.&lt;br /&gt;
 Lawmakers passed Act 73 to restructure the education system and reduce long-term costs, but disagreements remain over school consolidation and implementation, while other states like Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and South Dakota are considering similar reforms.&lt;br /&gt;
The Vermont experience shows that buying down taxes with surplus funds does not solve underlying funding problems, and provides a warning to states like Iowa that durable property tax relief depends on structural reform and spending restraint—not temporary patches.&lt;/p&gt;
