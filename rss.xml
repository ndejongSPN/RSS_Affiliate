Whether it’s Social Security at the federal level or Iowa’s IPERS program, these systems come with deep political roots—and big financial consequences. But as the cost of benefits grows, so does the need to keep promises without overburdening taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Iowa’s DOGE Taskforce is weighing a reform that could affect future public employees. The Taskforce’s Return on Investment Committee, chaired by the former mayor of Fort Dodge, Terry Lutz, has suggested Iowa consider shifting new public workers into a retirement model that resembles a 401(k). In other words, future employees—not current ones—would participate in a system based on contributions and investment performance, similar to what most private sector workers use.&lt;/p&gt;

Stanley (1928–2015) does not receive enough credit for building the conservative movement in Iowa. Stanley served in both the House and Senate of the Iowa Legislature, including leadership positions.

&lt;p&gt;David Stanley’s public service did not end once he left the legislature. He was a conservative who believed strongly in constitutional limited government. His public service therefore continued with founding and participating in numerous organizations that contributed to the conservative movement in Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
