AEA actively worked against the passage of the AAA Scholarship program, the PRICE Act, and the CHOOSE Act.

Further, AEA worked last legislative session to minimize funding for special needs kids, military kids, and kids whose families are living in poverty; they are currently working against future CHOOSE Act schoolchildren. AEA is trying to render void the promises legislators made to Alabama parents when they passed the law in 2024. They are attempting to undercut the work and the word of Governor Kay Ivey, Lt.

&lt;p&gt;True fiscal strength means standing on our own two feet—by knowing where every federal dollar goes, demanding transparency, and reasserting control within our own borders. The Iowa Fiscal Independence Act is the path toward lasting autonomy, responsible government, and a stronger future for Iowa taxpayers. For years, Iowans for Tax Relief Foundation has warned that Iowa’s growing reliance on Washington’s money would come with consequences. When the flow of federal dollars slows or stops, programs stall, services falter, and state budgets are left to pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas Governor Greg Abbott has made property tax reform the centerpiece of his reelection campaign, emphasizing that meaningful relief is impossible without controlling local government spending. Abbott’s proposed reforms—including strict spending caps, a two-thirds voter requirement for tax increases, and a rollback election option—aim to curb runaway local budgets and increase taxpayer protections. Iowa lawmakers, preparing their own 2026 property tax reform efforts, can draw lessons from Texas: real relief requires limiting local spending, improving transparency, and preventing workarounds that bypass voter accountability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proposals to tax out-of-state landowners at higher rates may sound appealing, but they raise significant concerns about fairness, economic consequences, and constitutionality. The U.S. Constitution—through the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Equal Protection Clause, and Commerce Clause—prohibits states from disadvantaging non-residents in property taxation, and courts have repeatedly struck down similar attempts. Real property-tax relief in Iowa will not come from targeting certain groups of taxpayers but from tackling the true source of rising tax bills: unchecked local government spending.&lt;/p&gt;
