&lt;p&gt;During 2025, the Atlantic CSD Board of Education decided to commit $18.5 million of its future 1-cent sales tax revenue—known as SAVE—for a new multipurpose indoor sports practice facility at Atlantic High School.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In two opinion essays for Governing, Stephen Legomsky, a law professor emeritus at Washington University and author of “Reimagining the American Union,” argues that many of the nation’s political problems are a direct result of federalism. The root of those problems, he contends, lies with the states. Yet a closer reading of his essays suggests the issue runs much deeper than federalism itself. His argument continues the progressive movement’s long campaign to fundamentally alter American constitutionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
