&lt;p&gt;Rising spending is driving rising property taxes. Lawmakers across the country are increasingly acknowledging that escalating local government spending — whether in schools, cities, or counties — is the root cause of higher property tax burdens. “Buying down” property taxes with state dollars has failed. Efforts in states like Vermont, Iowa, and Nebraska to offset property taxes with general fund revenue have often encouraged more local spending rather than delivering lasting tax relief. States are turning to spending caps. From Vermont and Kansas to Tennessee, Texas, and Iowa, policymakers are proposing spending and property tax caps, as structural reforms designed to impose discipline and provide sustainable relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sarah Curry of Iowans for Tax Relief Foundation says this is the time to voice your opinions to elected leaders. "April is when we have public hearings," Curry says. "Waiting until April is almost too late because they've done all of this legwork and they've gotten up to that point for taxpayers to then come in and say, 'That's too much,' or 'We're spending too much,' 'The tax rate's too high' or whatever." She says you want to talk to your elected officials. Iowans for Tax Relief offered points for school district taxpayers to consider at this point in the budgeting process. While some districts say they are going to make program or job cuts, Curry says there's usually more than one way to address facing a smaller budget. Then there are trends for taxpayers to think over, such as Iowa's declining birthrate. "Schools are funded on a per-student basis," Curry says. "So when you have less kids, you get less money."&lt;/p&gt;

Critics have framed it as a costly new entitlement at a time when the state faces budget pressures. But there’s a critical fact missing from much of the debate: When a student leaves the public school system and uses the tax credit instead, the state saves money. Here’s why. Idaho spends roughly $9,000 per student, per year, of state funds on public education.

&lt;p&gt;On March 3, 2026, voters in 12 Iowa school districts will decide public measures affecting property taxes and long-term school spending, including nine PPEL increases or renewals and three Revenue Purpose Statements (RPS). If approved, these measures could represent more than $150 million in potential property tax collections over the next decade, while RPS proposals would allow districts to redirect sales tax revenue from property tax relief to infrastructure projects. With historically low turnout in March special elections, a small percentage of voters may determine tax policy in their communities for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
