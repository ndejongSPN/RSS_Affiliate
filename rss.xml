The Workforce Committee is focused on expanding apprenticeship and internship programs in partnership with businesses and community colleges. Meanwhile, the Technology Committee is exploring the creation of a single, user-friendly portal where Iowans can renew licenses, pay fees, and even register to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taskforce has also proposed establishing a “Red Tape Hotline”—a unified online portal and call line where businesses, educators, and job seekers can report bureaucratic obstacles in real time. This innovation could help both state and local governments identify and eliminate unnecessary regulatory burden.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether it’s Social Security at the federal level or Iowa’s IPERS program, these systems come with deep political roots—and big financial consequences. But as the cost of benefits grows, so does the need to keep promises without overburdening taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why Iowa’s DOGE Taskforce is weighing a reform that could affect future public employees. The Taskforce’s Return on Investment Committee, chaired by the former mayor of Fort Dodge, Terry Lutz, has suggested Iowa consider shifting new public workers into a retirement model that resembles a 401(k). In other words, future employees—not current ones—would participate in a system based on contributions and investment performance, similar to what most private sector workers use.&lt;/p&gt;
