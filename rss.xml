&lt;p&gt;School bond campaigns often highlight levy rates to suggest affordability, but that figure alone doesn’t reveal how districts spend—or the true cost to taxpayers and students. Looking at districtwide per-student expenditures provides a clearer picture of financial trends and priorities. For instance, Des Moines’ per-student spending is up 24% in five years, and Southeast Polk’s has risen 66%. Districts should routinely publish per-student cost data by program or activity to help voters, taxpayers, and educators evaluate whether new borrowing truly delivers educational value.&lt;/p&gt;

AEA actively worked against the passage of the AAA Scholarship program, the PRICE Act, and the CHOOSE Act. AEA used political influence and political contributions to people and parties to weaken parental rights in the CHOOSE Act and then tried to kill the CHOOSE Act unless they could “control the spending” with a cap. Further, AEA worked last legislative session to minimize funding for special needs kids, military kids, and kids whose families are living in poverty; they are currently working against future CHOOSE Act schoolchildren. AEA is trying to render void the promises legislators made to Alabama parents when they passed the law in 2024. They are attempting to undercut the work and the word of Governor Kay Ivey, Lt. Governor Will Ainsworth, Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, Chairman Danny Garrett, Chairman Arthur Orr, and each of the ninety-two legislators who voted on behalf of the people they represent for universal school choice for Alabama’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across Iowa, more than 40 county hospitals receive a portion of their funding from local property taxpayers, totaling more than $150 million a year. These facilities are often essential—especially in rural areas where they may be the only source of emergency care. But when public dollars are involved, financial transparency takes on heightened importance. One key question Iowans are always entitled to ask is: How many tax dollars are actually necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
