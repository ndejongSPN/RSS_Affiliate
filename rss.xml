AEA actively worked against the passage of the AAA Scholarship program, the PRICE Act, and the CHOOSE Act. AEA used political influence and political contributions to people and parties to weaken parental rights in the CHOOSE Act and then tried to kill the CHOOSE Act unless they could “control the spending” with a cap. Further, AEA worked last legislative session to minimize funding for special needs kids, military kids, and kids whose families are living in poverty; they are currently working against future CHOOSE Act schoolchildren. AEA is trying to render void the promises legislators made to Alabama parents when they passed the law in 2024. They are attempting to undercut the work and the word of Governor Kay Ivey, Lt. Governor Will Ainsworth, Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, Chairman Danny Garrett, Chairman Arthur Orr, and each of the ninety-two legislators who voted on behalf of the people they represent for universal school choice for Alabama’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa outperforms Nebraska on tax policy, climbing rapidly in national competitiveness rankings thanks to major tax reforms, while Nebraska continues to lag behind in several key categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s pro-growth tax “playbook”—including a flat 3.8% income tax, elimination of retirement income and inheritance taxes—has strengthened its economic position and attracted migration from neighboring states like Nebraska.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Iowa’s strong lead, vulnerabilities such as high property taxes remain, underscoring the need for continued reform to maintain Iowa’s competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America’s earliest settlers believed government existed only to protect natural rights—especially property—not to manage society. Families, churches, and communities handled most social needs through voluntary cooperation, cultivating a citizenry capable of self-rule.&lt;br /&gt;
This founding worldview clashes with today’s rising property-tax burdens. Drawing on John Locke’s social-contract theory, the article argues that when government taxes away the fruits of a family’s labor or threatens their ability to stay in their home, it violates the very purpose for which government was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 1620, after arriving in Cape Cod, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact before setting foot on land. Though often overlooked today, the Compact remains a foundational document in the development of American constitutionalism and self-government. Constitutional scholar James McClellan wrote that by adopting the Compact, the Pilgrims brought a contractual theory of government to the New World—an idea that would later influence colonial charters, state constitutions, and even the U.S. Constitution itself.&lt;br /&gt;
This Thanksgiving, remembering the Mayflower Compact highlights the deep historical roots of American freedom and why these early commitments to self-rule remain a blessing worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;
