Mr. Blew reflects on his tenure in federal education leadership and his motivation for establishing DFI. He discusses the decades of rising federal K-12 spending through initiatives like RTTT, ESSA, and ESSER funds, instead calling for devolving federal authority out of the U.S. Department of Education, and more private school choice and charter public school innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inconsistent with Regional Trends: While Iowa clings to its sales tax holiday, most neighboring states have eliminated theirs, signaling a broader shift away from such exemptions in favor of more stable, broad-based tax systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weakens Tax Reform Efforts: The holiday erodes Iowa’s sales tax base at a time when the state is pursuing a simpler, flatter tax code on other fronts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outdated and Ineffective: Policy experts across the spectrum agree tax holidays are politically popular but economically unsound, offering more optics than impact.&lt;/p&gt;
