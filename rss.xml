&lt;p&gt;Tax debates are fundamentally imbalanced, treating government spending as virtuous while portraying taxpayers as selfish for wanting to keep more of what they earn. Spending pressures, not taxpayer capacity, drive tax increases, with policymakers and special interests too often defaulting to higher taxes rather than spending restraint. Tax reform alone is insufficient without structural limits, as shown by states like Washington; without guardrails, spending growth will eventually overwhelm tax relief, setting the stage for the need for constitutional protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tax reform without structural limits is temporary, as spending pressures and special interests will eventually overwhelm even well-designed tax cuts unless constitutional guardrails are put in place. Two key constitutional protections—a supermajority requirement for tax increases and protection of the flat tax—work together to restrain spending, reduce special-interest influence, and preserve economic freedom while still allowing responsible governance. Enshrining these protections would lock in Iowa’s pro-growth tax structure, ensuring long-term certainty, transparency, and discipline so that future prosperity benefits taxpayers rather than unchecked government expansion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITR Foundation is taking the property tax conversation directly to Iowans, engaging grassroots audiences alongside elected officials and candidates to address the real-world impact of rising property taxes. The data show a clear problem: Iowa property taxes have grown by more than 100 percent over the past two decades, far outpacing population growth and inflation, driven primarily by sustained growth in local government spending rather than assessments alone. Meaningful property tax relief requires spending discipline, including reasonable caps on revenue growth, to complement Iowa’s recent income tax reforms and ensure taxpayers, homeowners, farmers, and small businesses are not squeezed by unchecked local spending.&lt;/p&gt;
