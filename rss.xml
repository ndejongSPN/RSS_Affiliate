&lt;p&gt;The late David M. Stanley (1928–2015) does not receive enough credit for building the conservative movement in Iowa. Stanley served in both the House and Senate of the Iowa Legislature, including leadership positions. He served as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and as Senate Majority Leader. Stanley also ran twice to win election as a United States Senator, although unsuccessfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Stanley’s public service did not end once he left the legislature. He was a conservative who believed strongly in constitutional limited government. His public service therefore continued with founding and participating in numerous organizations that contributed to the conservative movement in Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Federalist Paper 11, Alexander Hamilton argued that one of the benefits of the proposed Constitution was the strengthening of the economy and ensuring the nation’s economic independence.[1] Hamilton closed by calling for the states to come together “in a strict and indissoluble union,” and creating a “great American system” of economy.[2] As a leading Federalist, Hamilton not only helped with the ratification of the Constitution, but he was selected by President George Washington to serve as the first Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton is credited for being the “father of American capitalism” and he was the architect of President Washington’s economic policies.&lt;/p&gt;
