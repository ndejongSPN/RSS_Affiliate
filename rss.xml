&lt;p&gt;In his speeches, Stanley spoke not only with authority and a thorough understanding of fiscal policy, but also with humor and flair. He referred to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as the “infernal revenue agency,” and he argued that citizens across the nation were being “taxed to death.” He told his audiences “the government is unable to control its appetite.” Only in government is slowing the growth of spending viewed as a cut. “A cut to them doesn’t mean the same thing that it does to you.

Even small-city councils establish these departments to signal support for economic growth and to boost city revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
