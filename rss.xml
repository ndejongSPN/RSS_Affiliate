&lt;p&gt;Iowa lawmakers have an opportunity to strengthen long-term taxpayer protections by advancing constitutional amendments that require a two-thirds legislative vote to raise income taxes and permanently protect the state’s flat tax. Supermajority requirements and flat-tax protections are widely supported by voters, common in other states, and serve as effective checks on unchecked spending and future tax increases. Enshrining these safeguards in the Iowa Constitution would preserve recent tax reforms, promote economic growth, and provide taxpayers with lasting confidence that Iowa’s tax system will remain fair, simple, and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s growing reliance on federal funding exposes the state to fiscal risk, policy mandates, and uncertainty driven by Washington, D.C. The Iowa Fiscal Independence Act would improve transparency, disclosure, and legislative oversight of federal funds to help lawmakers and taxpayers understand and manage those risks. By taking proactive steps toward fiscal independence, Iowa can strengthen state sovereignty, protect taxpayers, and reduce vulnerability to federal budget disruptions. Iowa’s finances are increasingly shaped by decisions made in Washington, not Des Moines. As federal funding grows more uncertain, the cost (and risk) of that dependence becomes harder for taxpayers to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa school districts such as Boone and Cedar Rapids are proposing major budget cuts, yet their per-pupil spending has risen sharply over the past five years and now sits well above the national average, with Iowa averaging over $22,000 per student. This growth was driven largely by school board spending decisions and the temporary influx of federal pandemic relief funds that masked enrollment declines and allowed districts to maintain higher spending levels. With those federal dollars now gone, districts must realign budgets with sustainable revenues, meaning today’s cuts reflect the end of temporary funding rather than true underfunding of schools.&lt;/p&gt;
