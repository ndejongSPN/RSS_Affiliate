&lt;p&gt;School boards control spending and every budget involves choices. While administrators draft proposals, boards hold the legal responsibility to set priorities. Claims that “we have no choice” should be questioned, because budgeting always involves tradeoffs in programs, staffing, compensation, benefits, and district structure. Spending decisions should be evaluated through a per-pupil and outcomes lens. Enrollment trends drive funding, making per-pupil spending a critical metric. Programs and projects—whether new buildings or tutoring initiatives—should be evaluated based on cost per student and measurable results. Long-term sustainability requires aligning staffing, compensation, facilities, and reserves with enrollment realities. Declining enrollment and rising benefit costs create financial pressure, making it essential to right-size operations, strategically reward effective educators, responsibly manage benefits, and use reserves for stability, not to delay difficult decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is often labeled “de-banking” is largely the result of an outdated and rigid federal regulatory framework rooted in the 1970s Bank Secrecy Act that incentivizes banks to over-comply to avoid severe penalties. Political signaling by regulators, combined with strict confidentiality rules around Suspicious Activity Reports, leaves banks cautious and opaque, fueling public frustration and perceptions of ideological targeting. Meaningful reform must occur at the federal level by modernizing compliance standards and disclosure rules; state-by-state approaches risk creating confusion without fixing the underlying problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising spending is driving rising property taxes. Lawmakers across the country are increasingly acknowledging that escalating local government spending — whether in schools, cities, or counties — is the root cause of higher property tax burdens. “Buying down” property taxes with state dollars has failed. Efforts in states like Vermont, Iowa, and Nebraska to offset property taxes with general fund revenue have often encouraged more local spending rather than delivering lasting tax relief. States are turning to spending caps. From Vermont and Kansas to Tennessee, Texas, and Iowa, policymakers are proposing spending and property tax caps, as structural reforms designed to impose discipline and provide sustainable relief.&lt;/p&gt;
