&lt;p&gt;Governor Kim Reynolds made clear in her Condition of the State address that Iowa’s property tax burden can no longer be ignored. The demand for reform cuts across geography and income. High property taxes affect seniors on fixed incomes, families struggling to make ends meet, small business owners, and young Iowans trying to save for their first home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether you live in a small town, growing suburb, or an urban neighborhood, you’ve probably felt it,” Governor Reynolds said. “Property taxes are rising faster than inflation, faster than paychecks, and faster than population growth.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rollback limits how fast taxable values grow—not how much governments tax. Iowa’s rollback prevents rapid increases in assessed property values from automatically turning into equally rapid increases in taxable value, providing predictability for taxpayers, but it does not cap local government spending or levy rates. The 3% cap is statewide and interacts with agriculture through the “Ag Tie.” Residential taxable value growth is capped at 3% statewide—and can be capped lower if agricultural values grow more slowly or decline—meaning individual properties, cities, or counties are not capped independently. Rising tax bills are driven by spending decisions, not rollback failure. Even with rollback in place, property tax bills can rise significantly when local governments increase spending; eliminating rollback would expose taxpayers to more volatility without addressing the real driver of higher taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regulatory reform is a structural issue of governance and accountability, centered on who makes the rules that shape Iowa’s economy and whether major policy decisions are made by elected lawmakers or unelected agencies. Large, costly regulations act as a hidden tax on Iowans, raising prices, slowing growth, and reducing opportunity—yet often take effect without the same scrutiny applied to major spending or tax decisions. REINS-style reforms emphasize legislative oversight, transparency, and separation of powers, seeking to restore lawmaking authority to the legislature while ensuring agencies implement the law as written, not expand it through regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
