&lt;p&gt;Iowa currently lacks a clear process to prevent a state government shutdown if a budget is not passed on time, creating uncertainty for taxpayers and essential services. A budget-continuation, or “no shutdown,” rule would ensure government operations continue by temporarily extending the prior year’s budget during impasses or emergencies. Adopting such a rule would promote stability, limit political brinkmanship, and align Iowa with best practices already used in other states. Last year, Iowans once again watched Washington struggle through another federal government shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa lawmakers have an opportunity to strengthen long-term taxpayer protections by advancing constitutional amendments that require a two-thirds legislative vote to raise income taxes and permanently protect the state’s flat tax. Supermajority requirements and flat-tax protections are widely supported by voters, common in other states, and serve as effective checks on unchecked spending and future tax increases. Enshrining these safeguards in the Iowa Constitution would preserve recent tax reforms, promote economic growth, and provide taxpayers with lasting confidence that Iowa’s tax system will remain fair, simple, and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s growing reliance on federal funding exposes the state to fiscal risk, policy mandates, and uncertainty driven by Washington, D.C. The Iowa Fiscal Independence Act would improve transparency, disclosure, and legislative oversight of federal funds to help lawmakers and taxpayers understand and manage those risks. By taking proactive steps toward fiscal independence, Iowa can strengthen state sovereignty, protect taxpayers, and reduce vulnerability to federal budget disruptions. Iowa’s finances are increasingly shaped by decisions made in Washington, not Des Moines. As federal funding grows more uncertain, the cost (and risk) of that dependence becomes harder for taxpayers to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
