AEA actively worked against the passage of the AAA Scholarship program, the PRICE Act, and the CHOOSE Act. AEA used political influence and political contributions to people and parties to weaken parental rights in the CHOOSE Act and then tried to kill the CHOOSE Act unless they could “control the spending” with a cap. Further, AEA worked last legislative session to minimize funding for special needs kids, military kids, and kids whose families are living in poverty; they are currently working against future CHOOSE Act schoolchildren. AEA is trying to render void the promises legislators made to Alabama parents when they passed the law in 2024. They are attempting to undercut the work and the word of Governor Kay Ivey, Lt. Governor Will Ainsworth, Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, Chairman Danny Garrett, Chairman Arthur Orr, and each of the ninety-two legislators who voted on behalf of the people they represent for universal school choice for Alabama’s children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide sustainable tax relief, Iowa must ensure that local government budgets grow no faster than taxpayers’ ability to pay. Limiting spending, coupled with responsible budgeting, is the cornerstone of true reform. Additional steps should also be considered. Local governments can improve efficiency by consolidating services, adopting zero-based budgeting, and regularly reviewing services to eliminate duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowans overwhelmingly want property tax relief, with 72% supporting a 2% cap on total property tax collections, signaling broad bipartisan demand for reform. Local government spending is the primary driver of rising property taxes, meaning any effective reform must focus on controlling spending and improving efficiency. Governor Reynolds is urging local governments to follow the state’s example by consolidating services, modernizing operations, and adopting cost-saving measures—because without meaningful spending restraint, tax relief will remain out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few years ago, the Tax Foundation ranked Iowa among the worst states for business tax climates. In 2020, Iowa placed 43rd in the State Tax Competitiveness Index. Thanks to the pro-growth policies of Gov. Kim Reynolds and the Legislature, Iowa has since climbed to 17th — a remarkable improvement. Yet despite this progress, Iowa still ranks 33rd nationally in property tax burden.&lt;/p&gt;
