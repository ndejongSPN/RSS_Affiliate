&lt;p&gt;S&amp;#038;P Global and Fitch Ratings have reaffirmed Iowa’s AAA credit rating, citing strong fiscal management, robust reserve levels, and prudent budgeting practices that continue to anchor the state’s financial position. Both rating agencies warned Iowa to maintain disciplined spending, noting risks tied to rising costs in education and Medicaid, economic headwinds in agriculture, and federal policy uncertainty that could pressure future budgets. As lawmakers prepare the FY 2027 budget, conservative budgeting remains key, with leaders encouraged to control spending growth to preserve Iowa’s strong reserves, credit rating, and long-term fiscal stability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2025, Iowa voters weighed in on 58 local bond proposals, which directly affect property tax bills for up to 20 years, with turnout significantly higher than in other local races. Average turnout for bond elections was 37.1%, more than double the statewide average for city and school elections, suggesting voters engage more when long-term tax impacts are clear. Higher voter participation leads to more representative outcomes in bond elections, reinforcing the importance of transparency and engagement in decisions that commit communities to long-term spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa leaders are making property tax reform a top priority in the 2026 session, but durable solutions require more than rate changes—they must follow established principles of sound tax policy. Tax policy should follow five guiding principles: fairness, competitiveness, transparency, limits on government growth, and protection of individual freedom. Lasting reform must broaden relief to all taxpayers and confront rising local government spending, rather than rely on targeted incentives, abatements, or structural complexity that shifts burdens without reducing them.&lt;/p&gt;
