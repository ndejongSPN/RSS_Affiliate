&lt;p&gt;For years, Iowans for Tax Relief Foundation has warned that Iowa’s growing reliance on Washington’s money would come with consequences. When the flow of federal dollars slows or stops, programs stall, services falter, and state budgets are left to pick up the pieces. Those warnings have proved correct. From federal policy changes in President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill to the current government shutdown, Iowa is learning what happens when dependence replaces discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings warns that Washington’s growing debt and spending reductions are pushing more fiscal responsibilities—like SNAP and Medicaid costs—onto state governments, exposing them to greater financial risk. Iowa remains fiscally strong thanks to conservative budgeting, but with 34% of its revenue tied to federal funds, changes from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and future federal austerity could strain state finances. To safeguard Iowa’s independence and long-term stability, policymakers must prepare for shrinking federal aid, limit spending growth, and reinforce the constitutional balance of federalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True fiscal strength means standing on our own two feet—by knowing where every federal dollar goes, demanding transparency, and reasserting control within our own borders. The Iowa Fiscal Independence Act is the path toward lasting autonomy, responsible government, and a stronger future for Iowa taxpayers. For years, Iowans for Tax Relief Foundation has warned that Iowa’s growing reliance on Washington’s money would come with consequences. When the flow of federal dollars slows or stops, programs stall, services falter, and state budgets are left to pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
