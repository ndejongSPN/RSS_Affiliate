&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s school income surtax, first adopted in 1971, is a district-level tax calculated as a percentage of a taxpayer’s Iowa income tax liability and used to support discretionary school programs.&lt;br /&gt;
Districts may combine the surtax with property taxes to fund the Instructional Support Levy (ISL) and the voter-approved Physical Plant and Equipment Levy (PPEL), adjusting the surtax rate annually to meet budget needs.&lt;br /&gt;
Over the past twenty years, the number of districts not using the surtax has steadily declined, making it an increasingly common but still little-understood part of Iowa’s school finance system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facing taxpayer frustration over rising property taxes, the City of Grand Rapids pursued a zero-percent levy increase by cutting or delaying nearly $1 million in spending. Minnesota’s Truth-in-Taxation process has empowered residents to engage meaningfully in budget decisions, with strong public turnout influencing both city and county officials. The experience demonstrates that transparency, taxpayer engagement, and spending discipline can lead to alternatives to automatic tax increases while preserving local accountability. Iowa should replicate Minnesota’s Truth-in-Taxation notice. Doing so would provide clearer property tax information and help encourage taxpayer participation by showing residents how proposed budgets directly affect their tax bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite ranking among the nation’s worst tax climates and having some of the highest income, sales, and property taxes, Massachusetts has successfully enforced a strong property tax cap through its Proposition 2½ for more than 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;
The cap limits annual levy growth to 2.5%, encourages disciplined budgeting, and includes a voter-approved override process, enabling communities to fund priorities without uncontrolled tax increases.&lt;br /&gt;
Massachusetts proves that even a high-spending state can maintain an effective property tax cap; Iowa can adopt similar limits without harming essential services or local government operations.&lt;/p&gt;
