&lt;p&gt;The federal government has officially shut down, and while the headlines focus on Washington, the real consequences are being felt here in Iowa. In Fiscal Year 2024, the State of Iowa received $13.2 billion in federal funds. Compare that to the legislature’s $9.4 billion state budget, and the picture is clear: Iowa relies heavily on Washington for many government programs. Cities collected another $545 million from the federal government just last year, adding to the dependency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s November 2025 city and school elections are quickly approaching, and voters will see 53 bond proposals on ballots across the state. Altogether, these measures seek approval for more than $1.5 billion in new borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that local governments repay debt with property taxes. While some districts claim they will “keep the rate the same,” the reality is that property taxes will still be higher than they otherwise would be—often for the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has stirred the hornet’s nest with his preference for tariffs. The President has even described the word “tariff” as one of the most beautiful words in the English language. Perhaps more than any other policy, including immigration, President Trump’s protectionism is the most controversial. For many within the conservative movement, tariffs are a betrayal of free-market economics and a rejection of the “true spirit” of Reagan conservatism. Further, protectionism is often assumed to be a policy favored by progressives and socialists.&lt;/p&gt;
