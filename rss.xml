&lt;p&gt;Schools have a core mission: to educate students. In every facet of life, a mission should guide how funds are spent. In education, that means every dollar should first support teaching and learning needs. Only after those needs are met should districts fund what’s considered “extra.” Unfortunately, that prioritization may not be happening in the Atlantic Community School District (CSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2025, the Atlantic CSD Board of Education decided to commit $18.5 million of its future 1-cent sales tax revenue—known as SAVE—for a new multipurpose indoor sports practice facility at Atlantic High School.&lt;/p&gt;
