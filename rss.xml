&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s November 2025 city and school elections are quickly approaching, and voters will see 53 bond proposals on ballots across the state. Altogether, these measures seek approval for more than $1.5 billion in new borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has stirred the hornet’s nest with his preference for tariffs. The President has even described the word “tariff” as one of the most beautiful words in the English language. Perhaps more than any other policy, including immigration, President Trump’s protectionism is the most controversial. For many within the conservative movement, tariffs are a betrayal of free-market economics and a rejection of the “true spirit” of Reagan conservatism. Further, protectionism is often assumed to be a policy favored by progressives and socialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assertion is often made that we live in “Alexander Hamilton’s America.” Hamilton, a co-author of The Federalist, served as Secretary of the Treasury under President George Washington and was the principal architect of that administration’s policies. As a leader of the Federalist Party, Hamilton often clashed with his Democratic-Republican critics, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, primarily over the role and scope of the federal government in relation to the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
