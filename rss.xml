&lt;p&gt;Economic development departments are often celebrated as promoters of prosperity and local employment. Each year, local governments spend tens of billions of dollars on economic development incentives—tax abatements, fee waivers, and direct subsidies—intended to lure private investment.

Even small-city councils establish these departments to signal support for economic growth and to boost city revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Iowans for Tax Relief Foundation (ITRF) poll of likely general election voters in Iowa reveals overwhelming and consistent support for taxpayer safeguards, including constitutional amendments to protect against income tax hikes, and limits on property tax increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey, conducted from September 22 to September 23, 2025, found that 71% of Iowans support requiring a two-thirds supermajority of the state legislature to approve any tax increases. This strong backing extends across political lines; 77% of independent voters, and 56% of democrat voters, favor this protection.&lt;/p&gt;
