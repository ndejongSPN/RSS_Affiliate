&lt;p&gt;In November 1620, after arriving in Cape Cod, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact before setting foot on land. Though often overlooked today, the Compact remains a foundational document in the development of American constitutionalism and self-government. Constitutional scholar James McClellan wrote that by adopting the Compact, the Pilgrims brought a contractual theory of government to the New World—an idea that would later influence colonial charters, state constitutions, and even the U.S. Constitution itself.&lt;br /&gt;
This Thanksgiving, remembering the Mayflower Compact highlights the deep historical roots of American freedom and why these early commitments to self-rule remain a blessing worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prediction of Supreme Court expansion sparks a deeper debate about whether sweeping institutional reforms align with or undermine the constitutional framework the Founders designed.&lt;br /&gt;
America was built as a republic, not a pure democracy, with federalism, separation of powers, the Electoral College, and an independent judiciary intentionally structured to restrain majority impulses and protect liberty.&lt;br /&gt;
Modern proposals to reshape long-standing institutions, from court packing to weakening states’ authority, reflect frustration with constitutional guardrails, but those guardrails are essential to preserving the republic “if we can keep it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Iowa taxpayers and legislators voiced overwhelming frustration with high property taxes, citing rising local spending and a lack of transparency. Audience testimony highlighted widespread concern about school spending priorities and commercial property burdens, with many noting that facilities expansion has outpaced academic results and that high property taxes are discouraging business investment. Participants agreed that meaningful property tax relief must address the root cause—local spending growth—and put taxpayers back at the center of the system, not simply tweak levy rates or formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
