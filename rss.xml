&lt;p&gt;Affordability pressures are real, but government spending helped cause them. Massive federal COVID-era spending—and unchecked state and local program expansion—flooded the economy with dollars, fueled inflation, and worsened affordability, meaning government should first examine its own role before proposing new interventions. Not all “affordability solutions” are rooted in free-market principles. Proposals like the Credit Card Competition Act rely on government intervention and controls and mandates, risking unintended consequences that undermine consumer choice, market efficiency, and financial innovation. Price controls on credit card interchange fees would likely do more harm than good. Interchange fees support fraud protection, payment security, and access to credit; government efforts to cap or regulate them exceed the proper role of government and could ultimately raise costs or reduce benefits for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bears want a new, publicly supported stadium despite taxpayers still paying for the last one. The team does not own Soldier Field, can exit its lease early, and is pursuing a “world-class” stadium even as Chicago taxpayers remain on the hook for more than $350 million in remaining renovation debt — potentially paying for years after the Bears leave. Taxes and subsidies are central to the relocation fight. The Bears are seeking massive infrastructure support and tax breaks, and Chicago’s high sales, labor, and commercial property taxes put it at a disadvantage compared to nearby states — illustrating how public policy decisions can influence where teams, businesses, and families choose to locate. Stadium subsidies often gamble public dollars on uncertain returns. Promises of economic growth and revitalization frequently fail to materialize, leaving taxpayers responsible for long-term debt, lost revenue, and ongoing maintenance while teams retain mobility and leverage — a pattern on full display in Chicago’s stadium saga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa’s budget remains structurally sound, but spending is accelerating: The FY 2026 budget totals about $9.4 billion—up more than 5 percent year over year—raising sustainability concerns even as lawmakers face a $1 billion shortfall that is not a true deficit due to large reserve balances. Strong reserves and credit ratings provide a cushion, not a blank check: Iowa closed FY 2025 with nearly $1.9 billion in surplus, more than $900 million in reserves, and roughly $4 billion in the Taxpayer Relief Fund, helping maintain AAA credit ratings—but rating agencies warn disciplined spending must continue. Tax reform was planned and paid for by restraint, not federal windfalls: The full phase-in of the 3.8 percent flat tax reduced state revenues as expected, leaving more money with taxpayers; maintaining conservative budgeting—rather than using reserves to fuel faster spending growth—is essential to preserve fiscal stability and enable future reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
