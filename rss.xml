&lt;p&gt;Iowa's Taxpayer Relief Fund originated in 2011 as the Taxpayer Trust Fund, which the legislature created to capture excess revenue for the purpose of income tax relief. Lawmakers believed it would ensure surplus tax collections ended up back in the pockets of taxpayers, not used for more state-level spending.&lt;br /&gt;
With its $3.6 billion balance, the fund is an attractive target for those who advocate for increased state spending, subsidies for local governments, or property tax “buy downs.” Some of these proposals have already been introduced. Constitutional protection would honor the fund’s original purpose and safeguard taxpayer dollars from being diverted to new spending programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa has been rated as one of the most fiscally prudent states for several years running, due to sound tax and spending policies. Yet thanks in part to a recent downturn in the agricultural economy, economic growth in the state has slowed. Additionally, the state has been losing residents to other states every year since 2013, and has one of the highest outflows of young residents with bachelor’s degrees, leading to some concern over a potential “brain drain.” Though government spending is often lauded as a tool for addressing these sorts of trends, Iowa will be better served by continuing to follow a path of fiscal conservatism. &lt;/p&gt;
