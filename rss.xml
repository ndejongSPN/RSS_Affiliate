&lt;p&gt;Each year, the Iowa legislature revisits the question of how much funding to allocate toward K–12 public education. At the same time, property taxpayers review proposed spending requests from their local school districts. And not to be left out, the federal government invests in K-12 education in Iowa, too.  Now, with the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent ruling curbing the power of federal agencies—and renewed discussion about dismantling the U.S. Department of Education—questions about control and funding have taken on new urgency. With so many funding sources and moving parts, one key question remains: How much money do Iowa’s public schools actually receive—and where does it come from?&lt;/p&gt;
