&lt;p&gt;Student enrollment declined in 2025: Iowa’s K–12 enrollment in public, charter, and private schools fell by about 1 percent in 2025, driven primarily by a 1.5 percent drop—more than 7,000 students—in public school enrollment. Public school trends drive overall enrollment, not private school growth: While private school enrollment increased modestly in 2025, those gains account for only about one-third of the students lost by public schools, making clear that private schools are not the primary cause of declining public school enrollment. Long-term forces matter more than single-year shifts: Enrollment trends reflect broader demographic and policy factors—including declining birth rates, post-COVID adjustments, open enrollment, and family schooling choices—underscoring the importance of focusing on long-term patterns rather than year-to-year changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rising property taxes are straining Iowa households and undermining affordability, highlighting the need for reform that protects both taxpayers’ budgets and their fundamental property rights. Property rights are a core American principle, rooted in the Founding era and affirmed by thinkers like James Otis and Barry Goldwater, who warned that excessive taxation erodes individual freedom as much as it raises revenue. Implementing firm limits on local government spending—such as a property tax cap—offers a proven solution, with examples from states like New York and Massachusetts showing that spending discipline can restrain tax growth while preserving essential services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Iowa has transformed its income tax system from one of the nation’s worst to a flat 3.8% rate, cutting the top rate by nearly 60% and dramatically improving the state’s tax competitiveness. This reform was made possible by conservative budgeting and spending discipline, which allowed Iowa to lower rates responsibly while maintaining strong reserves and fiscal stability. As other states continue to cut income tax rates in 2026, Iowa cannot afford to stand still, and continued spending restraint will be key to making future tax reductions possible.&lt;/p&gt;
