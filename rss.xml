&lt;p&gt;The ”joy riding” of government spending continues. Whether it is the $38 trillion national debt or the 108 percent increase in Iowa property tax collections over the past 20 years. Christianson understood the cause, government spending, and without limiting spending the situation would only deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theodore Christianson argued that unchecked government spending inevitably fuels higher taxes, bureaucracy, and reduced economic freedom, warning that government growth tends to feed on itself regardless of good intentions. He believed meaningful fiscal restraint required structural “brakes,” not rhetoric, including consolidated agencies, strict budget oversight, friction between spenders and budget guardians, and a willingness to veto excessive appropriations. Christianson maintained that lasting tax relief is impossible without disciplined spending and lower debt, viewing excessive taxation not just as an economic problem but as a threat to social stability, productivity, and long-term prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student enrollment declined in 2025: Iowa’s K–12 enrollment in public, charter, and private schools fell by about 1 percent in 2025, driven primarily by a 1.5 percent drop—more than 7,000 students—in public school enrollment. Public school trends drive overall enrollment, not private school growth: While private school enrollment increased modestly in 2025, those gains account for only about one-third of the students lost by public schools, making clear that private schools are not the primary cause of declining public school enrollment. Long-term forces matter more than single-year shifts: Enrollment trends reflect broader demographic and policy factors—including declining birth rates, post-COVID adjustments, open enrollment, and family schooling choices—underscoring the importance of focusing on long-term patterns rather than year-to-year changes.&lt;/p&gt;
