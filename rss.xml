&lt;p&gt;As we gather each July 4th for fireworks, pool parties, cookouts, and time with family, it’s easy to forget what the holiday actually commemorates: a revolution sparked, in large part, by a tax fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Independence Day celebrates the birth of a new nation, the catalyst for that bold break from Britain wasn’t just lofty ideas of liberty, it was taxation without representation. What began with protests in Boston soon became a widespread colonial movement. Today in Iowa, we face a different but equally pressing tax problem: one of consent, accountability, and runaway property taxes, now exceeding $7 billion in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
