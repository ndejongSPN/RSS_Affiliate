&lt;p&gt;Conservatives of the 1920s viewed the Constitution as the enduring foundation of American liberty, emphasizing limited government, federalism, and the need to preserve timeless principles rather than treat the document as obsolete. They rejected the progressive notion of a “living Constitution,” instead describing it as an anchor—flexible through amendment, but grounded in unchanging truths and rooted in prudence. These conservatives believed Americans have a duty to safeguard the Constitution. Through education, civic responsibility, and vigilance against drift, liberty can be protected for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Instructional Support Levy (ISL) is one of the main tools available to Iowa school districts to supplement state funding for educational programs. While the state sets limits on how much can be spent per student, the ISL provides districts with a way to go beyond that cap—funding additional staff, classroom resources, and other instructional needs. Because the levy can significantly affect local property taxes and school budgets, it is important for school board members, parents, and community members to understand how it works and how it is implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
