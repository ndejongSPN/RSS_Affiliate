Both can be true, but this debate misses the point: school choice is not a guarantor of student success, nor was it ever intended to be. Its purpose is to provide choices, and most agree that choice is good. Not all choices will be good, to be sure. Indeed, there are poor-performing charter and private schools, just as there are ineffective district schools. When systems with school choice features fail, we ought to blame and reform the choices—they are clearly of poor quality—not ban the freedom to choose. It is grossly undemocratic to suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money,” stated former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That timeless truth should guide Iowa policymakers as they approach the challenge of property tax reform. Across the nation, states are stumbling over how to address property taxes. A common excuse is that the system is both technical and complicated. Iowa’s property tax system is indeed technical and complicated—but that cannot be an excuse to delay or prevent reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently referred to as PPEL, this property tax is used by a majority of school districts amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars each year to pay for infrastructure. n Iowa, a PPEL (Physical Plant and Equipment Levy) is a property tax used by most school districts to spend on infrastructure and equipment, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School building construction, repairs, and maintenance&lt;br /&gt;
Purchase of technology and equipment&lt;br /&gt;
Transportation (e.g., school buses)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the great debates of our time is about how much of your money should be spent by the State and how much you should keep to spend on your family. Let us never forget this fundamental truth: the State has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves. If the State wishes to spend more it can do so only by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more. It is no good thinking that someone else will pay – that 'someone else' is you. There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers' money,” stated Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.&lt;/p&gt;
