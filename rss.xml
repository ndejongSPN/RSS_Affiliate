&lt;p&gt;Gov. Reynolds and the Legislature have an opportunity to make the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence especially meaningful by restoring balance between taxpayers and their local governments. By limiting spending, Iowa can protect the property rights that are the very foundation of American liberty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility that depends on local cooperation. Local officials are not meant to enforce immigration law themselves, but when they cooperate with federal authorities—by transferring custody after criminal cases are resolved—enforcement occurs quietly and efficiently, largely out of public view.  When states or cities refuse to cooperate, enforcement becomes more visible and confrontational. Resistance by local officials forces federal agents to conduct arrests in public spaces, increasing disruption, political backlash, and the likelihood of protest. Iowa looks different because its laws require cooperation and respect for the rule of law. As a result, immigration enforcement in Iowa is more orderly, less chaotic, and far less likely to trigger public unrest, illustrating how leadership and legal structure shape real-world outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iowa ranks 4th nationally for education freedom, earning top marks in the 2026 Index of State Education Freedom for expanding educational options and reducing barriers for families. Governor Kim Reynolds’ student-first reforms are driving the results, including universal Education Savings Accounts, expanded charter schools, and easier open enrollment—giving parents more control regardless of income or ZIP code. The rankings validate Iowa’s education direction, showing strong grades across student-centered funding, homeschooling, and virtual learning. Iowa has once again been recognized as a national leader in education freedom. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) recently released the 2026 edition of the Index of State Education Freedom, ranking Iowa 4th in the nation and awarding the state top marks for expanding educational opportunity and parental choice.&lt;/p&gt;
